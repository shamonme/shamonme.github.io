<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>Hello and welcome to my website about Dark Souls. Throughout this website you will find many useful tools to help you learn how to play this game and how to survive the tough parts of it.
<br><br>For many the video game Dark Souls is a completely foreign concept but those who have either played or just heard of it, you most likely know the game by its difficulty. To be fair, the game is quite difficult. However, the game is difficult in more or less fair ways. I find this game to be incredibly rewarding when you make any sort of progress because every challenge can and will be overcome by the intelligence of the player: and doesn't that feel great?
<br><br>Now, there are multiple ways you can play the game Dark Souls. You can play this game on the XBox 360, PlayStation 3, or on your computer. The game is most easily played with a controller, however a mouse and keyboard work as well. The genre is that of an Action RPG, and it is rated M.
<br><br>Now, each page in this website helps give insight on some of the more confusing parts of the game as well offer some suggestions on how to do this. Finally, I'm going to spoil as little of the game as possible, the screenshots you will be seeing will be only taken from the tutorial level of the game. Thank you for visiting and I wish you the best of luck on your quest!</p>
