<h1>Combat and You</h1>
<p>Combat in this game is done real-time and is very deadly. Even if you aren't fighting a boss things can turn sour very quickly if you're not careful.</p>

<br><p>You have two basic forms of attack with a melee weapon and those are categorized under strong and light attacks. Light attacks are quick and can be strung together to perform combos, however strong attacks deal far more damage but are slower and have a big windup. Try just playing around with these two types of attacks and get comfortable with them, you'll be using them a lot. There are a few other forms of attacks that you can discover throughout the game, but for now the basics can and will get you through the tutorial.
<br><br>Your left handed weapon in generally a shield. Many people avoid using them, however they are very important in this game. Shields reduce the damage you take from a physical attack by holding them up, but every attack you block reduces your stamina so be very careful you don't hold it up for too long or you can be left vulnerable. 
<br><br>You can focus on an enemy and have your controls allow you to sidestep around them and focus your attacks on them. There are many cases in the game where using this can be beneficial, however sometimes not targeting can be useful as well.
<br><br>Rolling.. ah rolling. This is how you avoid damage and perform almost immediate counterattacks. You can often times roll through an enemies attack without taking any damage if you time the roll right. However, depending on how much armor and weapons you have equipped depends on how quickly your character rolls.</p>
