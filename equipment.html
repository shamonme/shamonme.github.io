<h1>Equipment: Your Most Reliable Companion</h1>
<p>The equipment in this game is vast and more than double that of the game's precursor, “Demon's Souls.” I'll list out the type of equipment in this game, why and how to use them as well.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Weapons – There are a TON of weapons in this game, they include such things as daggers, swords, curved swords, greatswords, curved greatswords, ultra greatswords, thrusting swords, katanas, spears, halberds, axes, greataxes, hammers, greathammers, bows, crossbows, whips, and fist weapons. So if you end up not liking a certain type of weapon there are PLENTY to try out and play around with.<br></li>
	<li>Shields come in three types: small, medium, and greatshields. Small shields are better for parrying, medium shields are more resistant to damage and absorb blows a lot better, and greatshields are used to utterly deny an attack or type of elemental damage. These are incredibly important and first-time players would be well advised to use a medium shield the first play-through.<br></li>
	<li>Useable items are various items that either have finite or infinite uses. Your estus flask for example is a finite resource that recharges its uses when you visit a bonfire. Equip these in your equipment tab for quick usage.<br></li>
	<li>Armor is once again in three categories: light, medium, and heavy sets. You can mix and match sets for any appearance you want, however the heavier your armor, the slower your roll. Armor also provides a degree of damage reduction depending on the type of damage.<br></li>
	<li>Rings are probably the most important and understated items in the game. Rings can determine a certain play style or make you unstoppable to certain foes. I can't go much into rings without spoiling the game, however plan on getting a large arsenal of them to your use and switching them out to help you.<br></li>
	<li>Magic is yet another vast topic that spans many aspects of the game as well. Without going too far in detail I'll describe each set of magic and what they're good for.<br>
	<ol type="a">
		<li>Sorceries – These spells require a high intelligence stat to use and are mostly attack based. There are some utility-based ones, however they are far and in-between. You need a catalyst in order to cast these.<br></li>
		<li>Miracles – These spells require a high faith stat to use and are largely healing and utility-based. There is probably only one damage dealing miracle in the game, so don't use these if you want to deal magical damage. You need a talisman to cast these.<br></li>
		<li>Pyromancies – Now, this is pretty much the in-between of the three spells. There are equally as many attack and utility based spells in the pyromancy spell-list AND these spells do not require any stat to cast, merely a pyromancy flame weapon. HOWEVER, these spells use the largest amount of atunement slots which determine how many spells you can prepare at a bonfire making them oftentimes almost not worthwhile. </li>
	</ol></li>
