<h1>About the Author</h1>
<p>My name is Benjamin Ward, I am currently enrolled in SDCCD's WEBD 162 fall class and this website is my final project for that class. The purpose of creating this website is actually because of my love for this game and the company who designed and created it. Many of my friends have asked me questions regarding this and have often given up playing pretty early on so I felt inspired to make something that they or even other people could use to help give them that edge on adventuring through Lordran.
<br><br>About 3 or so years ago my brother would often pester me to play this game. I finally gave in, suffered through about a 40ish hour play-through and found myself completely at awe to this game. The difficulty and reward, the subtle yet powerful story, the amazing world.. I was hooked and I needed more. So I played through the sequel Dark Souls 2, the precursor Demon's Souls, the new IP Bloodborne, and finally and most recently Dark Souls 3. I have beaten these games many times over each and I feel like I have a fantastic grasp on the game sense and game-play elements in this particular franchise.
