<h1>Tips and Tricks</h1>
<p>This game is notoriously hard. The only real way you get better is by practice and a whole lot of dying. Fortunately I've already done all of the above, so I'll be going over some good tips and tricks to help you get through this game!
<br><br>At some point you may think that grinding for souls may be the option you need to get through the game. In all seriousness though, killing bosses is the best way to get souls to level up. The only time you should grind is to get titanite shards or other upgrade materials to level up.
<br><br>If you know a boss is ahead (like an ominous fog wall) then use your souls. You'll be thanking yourself when you die upwards of ten times on that boss and you don't lose all those souls you've been saving up since the last boss.
<br><br>If a boss is too hard and you're online, try summoning another player. They probably have beaten this boss before and can definitely help you out!</p>

<p>The first thing you should do when you enter a boss's arena is look around. The game designers spent a lot of time and effort making these places and you may even find an exploit or some way of avoiding damage from an attack while you chug estus.
<br><br>When leveling up, if you don't know what to choose: go vitality and endurance.</p>

<p>Finally, the game will be incredibly frustrating sometimes. You WILL lose your souls. Just accept it and take a break if that's what you need to do. You'd be surprised how much a clear head can help you out!
<br><br>Thanks for visiting my website, good luck out there!</p>
